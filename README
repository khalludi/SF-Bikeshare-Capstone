I have created a regression model to predict the amount of trips that will take place in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Libraries:
    pandas
    matplotlib
    scikit-learn
    
The dataset that I used should be included. If not, you can download it here: https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/sf-bay-area-bike-share
